Ã— Migration failed: Incompatible peer dependencies found.
Peer dependency warnings when installing dependencies means that those dependencies might not work correctly together.
You can use the '--force' option to ignore incompatible peer dependencies and instead address these warnings later.

** Executing migrations of package '@angular/core' **

> In Angular version 11, the type of `AbstractControl.parent` can be `null` to reflect the runtime value more accurately.
  This migration automatically adds non-null assertions to existing accesses of the `parent` property on types like `FormControl`, `FormArray` and `FormGroup`.
  Migration completed.

> ViewEncapsulation.Native has been removed as of Angular version 11.
  This migration replaces any usages with ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom.
  Migration completed.

> NavigationExtras omissions migration.
  In version 11, some unsupported properties were omitted from the `extras` parameter of the `Router.navigateByUrl` and `Router.createUrlTree` methods.
  Migration completed.

> Updates the `initialNavigation` property for `RouterModule.forRoot`.
  Migration completed.

> NavigationExtras.preserveQueryParams has been removed as of Angular version 11.
   This migration replaces any usages with the appropriate assignment of the queryParamsHandling key.
  Migration completed.

> The default value for `relativeLinkResolution` is changing from 'legacy' to 'corrected'.
This migration updates `RouterModule` configurations that use the default value to
now specifically use 'legacy' to prevent breakages when updating.
  UPDATE src/app/app-routing.module.ts (1012 bytes)
  Migration completed.

> `async` to `waitForAsync` migration.
  The `async` testing function has been renamed to `waitForAsync` to avoid confusion with the native `async` keyword.
