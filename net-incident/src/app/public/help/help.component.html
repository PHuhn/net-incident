			Network Incidents is meant to help in the process of reporting to an ISP 
			that an IP address from their network has in-properly probed your 
			device or server.
			
			Their are many pain points in the process of reporting network incidents.

			This streamlines getting the abuse e-mail address and the construction of
			the e-mail to the ISP.

			It also yields an id for this incident that can be used in the correspondence.
		</p>
		<p>
			This does not cover the pain points of extraction, categorization and 
			loading of various logs.

			Additionally, one needs some sort of emailing solution to be configured 
			in the web service site.

			This is normally SMTP relay to a local e-mail server/service,
			but SendGrid and MailGun may be an option.

			No facility exist for loading ISP response into the 'notes', 
			except for cut and paste.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application starts with network logs of various intrusions (only the intrusions).

			The logs are loaded with the appropriate server id and intrusion type id.

			From the application one selects the server and adds an incident.

			One selects (checks) the incident and the application will collect all 
			like IP addresses, and attempt to lookup the abuse e-mail address, NIC and ISP name.
		</p>
		<p>
			This application gets the abuse e-mail address, NIC and ISP name by the whois command on the server.

			Whois communicates to various Regional Internet Registries or RIR's around the worlds.

			The primary RIR's are as follows:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td style='width:100px;'>afrinic.net</td><td>Africian Network Information Centre</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>apnic.net</td><td>Asian-Pacfic Network Information Centre</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>arin.net</td><td>Americian (North) Registry of Internet Numbers</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>lacnic.net</td><td>Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ripe.net</td><td>Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (Europe)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			The individual repositories are also called Network Information Center or NIC.
			NIC's is the term that this applicaion uses.
