I have a Netgear 300 wireless router.  The router logs are available by e-mail, 
or logging on as the administrator copying the logs to a text file.  I did the latter.
I save the file as NG-300-2018-05-03.txt
I ran the following batch command (text file name minus the extent of txt).

C:\...\logs> LogFilter NG-300-2018-05-03

This should create two files 

* NG-300-2018-05-03.admin.txt
* NG-300-2018-05-03.probe.txt

Launch the PowerShell ISE

Change directory as follows to the working directory:

PS C:> cd C:\Dat\Nsg\L\Web\Ng\NetIncidents3\logs

You can get help for the logs load Netgear powershell script as follows:

PS C:> get-help .\LogsLoad-NG.ps1 -full

You can run the logs load Netgear powershell script as follows:

PS C:> .\LogsLoad-NG.ps1 -server ".\Express" -filePath "C:\Dat\Nsg\L\Web\Ng\NetIncidents3\logs\ng-300-2018-05-03-probe.txt" -serverId 4 -incidentTypeId 1026

Thanks and good luck and help make the internet safe.
